If you've written a Python library and you'd like to create a GUI application for it using PyQt (a set of Python bindings for The Qt Companyâ€™s Qt application framework), follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Your Environment**:
   - If you haven't already, install PyQt:
     ```bash
     pip install pyqt5 pyqt5-tools
     ```

2. **Design the GUI**:
   - You can use the Qt Designer (which comes with `pyqt5-tools`) to design your GUI. Once you've finished, save the design as a `.ui` file.
   - Convert the `.ui` file to a `.py` file:
     ```bash
     pyuic5 -x your_design.ui -o design.py
     ```

3. **Integrate Your Library**:
   - Import your library and the generated `design.py` file into a new Python script.
   - Create a class (e.g., `AppWindow`) that inherits from the main window class in `design.py` and `QMainWindow`.
   - In this class, connect your library functions to the GUI elements (e.g., buttons, input fields).

4. **Example**:
   Let's assume you've created a library `mylib.py` with a function `compute(x)` and you've created a GUI with an input field, a button, and a label.

   ```python
   import sys
   from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMainWindow
   import design
   import mylib

   class AppWindow(QMainWindow, design.Ui_MainWindow):
       def __init__(self):
           super().__init__()
           self.setupUi(self)
           self.computeButton.clicked.connect(self.on_compute)

       def on_compute(self):
           x = float(self.inputField.text())
           result = mylib.compute(x)
           self.resultLabel.setText(str(result))

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app = QApplication(sys.argv)
       window = AppWindow()
       window.show()
       sys.exit(app.exec_())
   ```

5. **Run Your Application**:
   - Simply run the script you created in the previous step, and your GUI should appear, with your library's functionality integrated.

Remember that these steps are a general guideline, and the exact implementation might differ based on the specifics of your library and your desired GUI design.

Creating multi-window dynamic GUIs with PyQt involves handling multiple windows, dialogues, and interactions between them. Here's a basic guide to creating a multi-window application with PyQt:

1. **Set Up Your Environment**:
   - If you haven't already, install PyQt:
     ```bash
     pip install pyqt5 pyqt5-tools
     ```

2. **Design Multiple Windows**:
   - Use Qt Designer to design each of your windows. Save each design as a separate `.ui` file.
   - Convert each `.ui` file to a `.py` file using the `pyuic5` tool.

3. **Create Main Application File**:
   - Import the necessary PyQt5 modules and your generated `.py` GUI designs.
   - Create a main window class and initialize other window classes within it or initialize them when certain actions occur, like button clicks.

4. **Example**:
   Let's create a main window with a button that opens a secondary window:

   - Convert your main window `.ui` file and secondary window `.ui` file to `.py` files. Let's call them `main_window.py` and `second_window.py`.

   - Create a new Python script for your application:
     ```python
     import sys
     from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMainWindow, QDialog
     import main_window
     import second_window

     class MainApp(QMainWindow, main_window.Ui_MainWindow):
         def __init__(self):
             super().__init__()
             self.setupUi(self)
             self.openSecondWindowButton.clicked.connect(self.open_second_window)

         def open_second_window(self):
             self.second_window = SecondApp(self)
             self.second_window.show()

     class SecondApp(QDialog, second_window.Ui_Dialog):
         def __init__(self, parent=None):
             super(SecondApp, self).__init__(parent)
             self.setupUi(self)

     if __name__ == '__main__':
         app = QApplication(sys.argv)
         main_win = MainApp()
         main_win.show()
         sys.exit(app.exec_())
     ```

   In this example, the `MainApp` class corresponds to the main window of the application, and the `SecondApp` class corresponds to the secondary window. When the `openSecondWindowButton` button is clicked in the main window, the secondary window is opened.

5. **Dynamically Update Windows**:
   - To dynamically update content on windows, create methods inside your window classes that modify widgets. For example, if you want to update a label on `SecondApp` from `MainApp`, you could define a method in `SecondApp` and call it from `MainApp`.

6. **Inter-Window Communication**:
   - Use signals and slots for more complex interactions. For example, you can emit a signal from the secondary window when data is updated and connect it to a slot in the main window to take an action.

This guide gives you a basic structure to start with. As you develop more complex multi-window applications, you'll get into more advanced features of PyQt like layouts, model/view programming, custom widgets, etc.

To create an interactive window in PyQt that allows the user to write and modify text, you can use `QTextEdit`. Here's a simple example:

1. **Set Up Your Environment**:
   - If you haven't already, install PyQt:
     ```bash
     pip install pyqt5 pyqt5-tools
     ```

2. **Create the GUI**:
   - We'll create a window with a `QTextEdit` where users can type and modify text. We'll also add a button that when clicked, modifies the text in the `QTextEdit` to demonstrate programmatically changing the text.

Here's the code:

```python
import sys
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMainWindow, QTextEdit, QPushButton, QVBoxLayout, QWidget

class TextApp(QMainWindow):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

        # Initialize the QTextEdit
        self.text_edit = QTextEdit(self)

        # Button to change text
        self.btn = QPushButton("Change Text", self)
        self.btn.clicked.connect(self.change_text)

        # Set layout
        layout = QVBoxLayout()
        layout.addWidget(self.text_edit)
        layout.addWidget(self.btn)

        container = QWidget()
        container.setLayout(layout)

        self.setCentralWidget(container)

        self.setWindowTitle("Interactive Text Window")
        self.setGeometry(100, 100, 400, 300)

    def change_text(self):
        """Change the text of the QTextEdit when the button is clicked"""
        self.text_edit.setText("The text has been changed!")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    window = TextApp()
    window.show()
    sys.exit(app.exec_())
```

Run the above code. You'll see a window with a text area where you can write and modify text. Below the text area, there's a button that when clicked, changes the text in the text area.

This example demonstrates the basics. You can expand this further by adding more widgets and functionalities as per your requirements.
