| Attribute | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Required or optional |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `style`     | The voice-specific speaking style. You can express emotions like cheerfulness, empathy, and calmness. You can also optimize the voice for different scenarios like customer service, newscast, and voice assistant. If the style value is missing or invalid, the entire mstts:express-as element is ignored and the service uses the default neutral speech. For custom neural voice styles, see the custom neural voice style example. | Required             |
`styledegree` | The intensity of the speaking style. You can specify a stronger or softer style to make the speech more expressive or subdued. The range of accepted values are: 0.01 to 2 inclusive. The default value is 1, which means the predefined style intensity. The minimum unit is 0.01, which results in a slight tendency for the target style. A value of 2 results in a doubling of the default style intensity. If the style degree is missing or isn't supported for your voice, this attribute is ignored. | Optional
`role` | The speaking role-play. The voice can imitate a different age and gender, but the voice name isn't changed. For example, a male voice can raise the pitch and change the intonation to imitate a female voice, but the voice name isn't be changed. If the role is missing or isn't supported for your voice, this attribute is ignored. | Optional
`contour` | Contour represents changes in pitch. These changes are represented as an array of targets at specified time positions in the speech output. Sets of parameter pairs define each target. For example:

   ```xml
   <prosody contour="(0%,+20Hz) (10%,-2st) (40%,+10Hz)">
   ```

The first value in each set of parameters specifies the location of the pitch change as a percentage of the duration of the text. The second value specifies the amount to raise or lower the pitch by using a relative value or an enumeration value for pitch (see pitch). | Optional

`pitch` | Indicates the baseline pitch for the text. Pitch changes can be applied at the sentence level. The pitch changes should be within 0.5 to 1.5 times the original audio. You can express the pitch as: **An absolute value**: Expressed as a number followed by `Hz` (Hertz). For example

  ```xml
  <prosody pitch="600Hz">some text</prosody>.
  ```

**A relative value**: **As a relative number**: Expressed as a number preceded by `+` or `-` and followed by `Hz` or `st` that specifies an amount to change the pitch. The `st` indicates the change unit is semitone, which is half of a tone (a half step) on the standard diatonic scale. For example:

  ```xml
  <prosody pitch="+80Hz">some text</prosody>
  ```

  or

  ```xml
  <prosody pitch="-2st">some text</prosody>
  ```

**As a percentage**: Expressed as a number preceded by "+" (optionally) or "-" and followed by "%", indicating the relative change.
  For example:

  ```xml
  <prosody pitch="50%">some text</prosody>
  ```

  or

  ```xml
  <prosody pitch="-50%">some text</prosody>
  ```

**A constant value**: `x-low`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `x-high`, `default`

Optional

`range` | A value that represents the range of pitch for the text. You can express range by using the same absolute values, relative values, or enumeration values used to describe pitch. | Optional
`rate` | Indicates the speaking rate of the text. Speaking rate can be applied at the word or sentence level. The rate changes should be within 0.5 to 2 times the original audio. You can express rate as: **A relative value**:

- **As a relative number**: Expressed as a number that acts as a multiplier of the default. For example, a value of 1 results in no change in the original rate. A value of 0.5 results in a halving of the original rate. A value of 2 results in twice the original rate.
- **As a percentage**: Expressed as a number preceded by `+` (optionally) or `-` and followed by `%`, indicating the relative change.
  For example:

  ```xml
  <prosody rate="50%">some text</prosody>
  ```

  or

  ```xml
  <prosody rate="-50%">some text</prosody>.
  ```

- **A constant value**: | `x-slow`, `slow`, `medium`, `fast`, `x-fast`, `default` | Optional
`volume` | Indicates the volume level of the speaking voice. Volume changes can be applied at the sentence level. You can express the volume as:

- **An absolute value**: Expressed as a number in the range of 0.0 to 100.0, from quietest to loudest, such as 75. The default value is 100.0.
- **A relative value**:
- **As a relative number**: Expressed as a number preceded by `+` or `-` that specifies an amount to change the volume. Examples are +10 or -5.5.
- **As a percentage**: Expressed as a number preceded by `+` (optionally) or `-` and followed by `%`, indicating the relative change.

  - For example:

    ```xml
    <prosody volume="50%">some text</prosody>
    ```

    or

    ```xml
    <prosody volume="+3%">some text</prosody>
    ```

- **A constant value**: `silent` | `x-soft` | `soft` | `medium` | `loud` | `x-loud` | `default`
